## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Server Side (`server/`)

| File | What it implements |
|------|-------------------|
| `server.py` | Main TCP server using `socket` and `threading`. Accepts client connections, spawns a thread per client. |
| `handlers.py` | Request dispatcher - routes JSON actions (`register`, `login`, `upload_game`, `create_room`, etc.) to appropriate handlers. |
| `auth.py` | User authentication - password hashing with `hashlib`, session token generation, login/register logic. |
| `data.py` | JSON file database layer - CRUD operations for `users.json`, `games.json`, `rooms.json` with file locking. |
| `game_manager.py` | Game upload/download - receives chunked file uploads, stores ZIPs, manages game metadata. |
| `lobby_manager.py` | Room management - create/join/leave rooms, ready status, player tracking. |
| `game_runtime.py` | Game server launcher - extracts game files, spawns game server subprocess on assigned port. |

### Developer Client (`developer_client/`)

| File | What it implements |
|------|-------------------|
| `client.py` | Entry point - establishes socket connection to server, starts menu loop. |
| `menu.py` | Developer menu UI - displays options, handles user input, calls appropriate functions. |
| `auth.py` | Developer authentication - sends `register`/`login` requests to server, stores session token. |
| `game_upload.py` | Game upload - ZIPs local game folder, sends via chunked file transfer protocol. |
| `game_manage.py` | Game management - list uploaded games, update game version, delete (unlist) games. |

### Player Client (`player_client/`)

| File | What it implements |
|------|-------------------|
| `client.py` | Entry point - establishes socket connection to server, starts menu loop. |
| `menu.py` | Player menu UI - displays options, handles user input, calls appropriate functions. |
| `auth.py` | Player authentication - sends `register`/`login` requests to server, stores session token. |
| `store.py` | Game store - browse games, view details, download games via chunked file transfer. |
| `library.py` | Local game library - lists downloaded games from `games/<username>/` folder. |
| `lobby.py` | Game lobby - create/join rooms, waiting room with ready system, auto-launch game client. |
| `review.py` | Review system - submit ratings (1-5) and comments for downloaded games. |

### Utils (`utils/`)

| File | What it implements |
|------|-------------------|
| `protocol.py` | JSON protocol - 4-byte length-prefixed message format, `send_json()` and `recv_json()` functions. |
| `file_transfer.py` | Chunked file transfer - sends/receives large files in chunks with progress tracking. |

### Games (`developer_client/games/`)

| Game | Server | Client | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Gomoku | `gomoku_server.py` | `gomoku_client_gui.py` | 15x15 board, 2 players take turns, first to 5-in-a-row wins. Uses Tkinter GUI. |
